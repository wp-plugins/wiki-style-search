Wiki Style Search bypasses search results and directs users directly to an article if an article name matches their query.

== Description ==

Wiki Style Search will cause WP's search to go directly to a page or post if a page or post's title matches the search query; otherwise search results will display as usual. Plugin makes search function similar to that of Wikipedia.

For Example:

	- A search query of 'spider': http://thelargest.net/?s=spider takes you to http://thelargest.net/spider
	- A search query of 'cruise ship': http://thelargest.net/?s=cruise+ship takes you to http://thelargest.net/cruise-ship
